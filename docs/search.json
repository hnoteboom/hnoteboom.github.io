The dataset I am using is compiled of 46,412 schools across 32 US States for the 2017-2018 or 2018-2019 (depending on state) school year. This data looks specifically at the vaccine for Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (mmr). The vaccine is federally mandated in public schools but some children are exempt due to medical or religious reasons and there have been other ways that schools can avoid vaccine mandates. I wanted to see if the type of school influenced vaccine rates, the types of schools in this dataset are:\n\nPublic\nPrivate\nCharter\nKindergarten\nBOCES\n\nPublic schools are those funded by the government. Private schools are privately owned and not government funded. Charter schools are also publicly funded but operate outside of the established state school system. Kindergarten are schools for only elementary school students. BOCES is a special program in New York that serves as an extension of publicly funded schools. Despite being publicly funded, charter schools have more flexibility than regular public schools when it comes to curriculum and operations. I wanted to see if this flexibility made a difference in vaccination rates.\nMy research question is:\nIn the population, do public schools have higher vaccination rates than charter schools on average?\n\\(H_0\\) = \\(\\mu_{\\text{public}} = \\mu_{\\text{charter}}\\)\n\\(H_A\\) = \\(\\mu_{\\text{public}} &gt; \\mu_{\\text{charter}}\\)\nThe graph below shows the average vaccination rate for Public and Charter Schools.\n\nc_p_measles &lt;- measles |&gt; \n  select(type, mmr) |&gt; \n  filter(type == \"Charter\" | type == \"Public\") |&gt;\n  group_by(type) |&gt;\n  filter(mmr &gt; 1)|&gt;\n  summarize(ave_rate = mean(mmr))\n\nggplot(c_p_measles, aes(x = type, y = ave_rate, fill = type)) +\n  geom_col()+ \n  labs(\n    x = \"School Type\", \n    y = \"Average Vaccination Rate\", \n    title = \"MMR Vaccination Rate at Different Schools\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc_p_measles |&gt; \n  summarize(ave_diff = diff(ave_rate))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  ave_diff\n     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     8.21\n\n\nI found that the difference between the average vaccine rates for Public and Charter schools to be 8.211511. To test if this is outside the null distribution, I conducted a permutation test in which I scrambled the mmr rates. The histogram of the null distribution can be seen below and the red line marks the observed difference between vaccination rates.\n\nperm_test &lt;- function(rep, data) {\n  data |&gt;\n    select(type, mmr) |&gt; \n    filter(type == \"Public\" | type == \"Charter\") |&gt; \n    filter(mmr &gt; 1) |&gt;\n    mutate(mmr_perm = sample(mmr, replace = FALSE)) |&gt;\n    group_by(type) |&gt;\n    summarize(ave_rate = mean(mmr), \n              ave_rate_perm = mean(mmr_perm)) |&gt; \n    summarize(ave_diff = diff(ave_rate), \n              ave_diff_perm = diff(ave_rate_perm), \n              rep = rep)}\n\nset.seed(44)\nperm_stats &lt;- \n  map(c(1:500), perm_test, data = measles) |&gt; \n  list_rbind() \n\nperm_stats |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = ave_diff_perm)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins = 50) + \n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = ave_diff), color = \"red\") + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Null distribution\", \n    x = \"Average difference\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperm_stats |&gt; \n  summarize(p_val_ave = mean(ave_diff_perm &gt; ave_diff))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  p_val_ave\n      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1         0\n\n\nI found that the p-value is 0 which means the result is statistically significant as p-value &lt; 0.05. Therefore we can accept the alternative hypothesis and say that on average,public schools have higher vaccination rates than charter schools.\n\n\nReferences\nTidy Tuesday source:\nhttps://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2020/2020-02-25\nOriginal source: https://github.com/WSJ/measles-data"

    "text": "Dataset\nThe data I have chosen is about board games that were released between 1950 and 2016. The data comes from the site BoardGameGeek which is a website for board game enthusiasts that features reviews, forums, and board game data. The dataset has information about each games category, release date, description, average rating, and more.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nboard_games &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2019/2019-03-12/board_games.csv\")\n\n\n\nAnalysis 1\nI first wanted to find out what the most common words in the titles of games were. I filtered out filler words like “the”, “and”, “to”, etc. The top ten most common words board game titles can be seen in the table below.\n\nboard_games |&gt;\n  mutate(words = str_extract_all(name, \"\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b\")) |&gt;  \n  unnest(words) |&gt;                                         \n  count(words, sort = TRUE) |&gt; \n  filter(!str_detect(words, \"^(?i)(the|of|to|game|s|in|and|a|for|at)$\"))|&gt;\n  head(10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   words        n\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1 War        270\n 2 Edition    215\n 3 Card       201\n 4 Battle     140\n 5 Star       125\n 6 Wars       118\n 7 edition    107\n 8 World      101\n 9 Dice        99\n10 Monopoly    72\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis 2\nSince War was the most common word in game names I decided to look at how many war related games there were. The dataset has a column called category in which the content category of the game is represented. One game can have several categories listed, categories include: fantasy, exploration, adventure, wargame, and many more. I wanted to explore how many games per year are categorized as wargames and if there has been a change in the number of war games released per year. The graphs below explores this question.\n\nwar_games &lt;- board_games |&gt; \n  select(name, year_published, category, average_rating) |&gt; \n  group_by(year_published)|&gt; \n  summarize(\n    games_per_year = n(), \n    war_games = sum(str_detect(category, \"(?i)wargame\")), \n    name = name)|&gt; \n  filter(war_games &gt; 0) |&gt; \n  mutate(proportion = war_games/games_per_year)\n\nggplot(war_games, aes(x = year_published, y = war_games)) + \ngeom_point() + \ngeom_line() + \nlabs(\n  title = \"Number of war games published per year from 1955-2016\", \n  x = \"year\", \n  y = \"number of games published\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(war_games, aes(x = year_published, y = proportion)) + \ngeom_point() + \ngeom_line() + \nlabs(\n  title = \"Proportion of war games published per year from 1955-2016\", \n  x = \"year\", \n  y = \"proportion of total games\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first graph shows a sharp increase in the number of war games released between 1970 and 1980 and another sharp increase after 2000. From this graph it would be tempting to say that overall there has been an overall increase in the number of war related game sinse the mid 1900’s. However, it is important to take into account the total number of released games. The second graph shows the proportion of games that are considered war games. In this graph we can see that following a low period in the mid-60s, there was a dramatic increase in proportion from the 1970-1980. This aligns with what the first graph showed. The second graph shows that between 1990 and 2000 the proportion of war games decreased and in 2016 the proportion of war games was relatively the same as in 1965. These graphs demonstrate the importance of looking at proportion instead of just quantity.\n\n\nAnalysis 3\n\nboard_games |&gt; \n  select(name, year_published, category, average_rating) |&gt;\n  mutate(war = str_extract(category, \"((?&lt;=World War )I+)|(?i)Fantasy.*wargame\")) |&gt; \n  mutate(war = str_sub(war, 1, 7))|&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(war)) |&gt;\n  group_by(war) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    count = n(), \n    average_rating = sum(average_rating)/n())\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  war     count average_rating\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;int&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Fantasy   139           6.59\n2 I         116           6.91\n3 II        668           6.88\n\n\nThe table above shows how many games were published that were categorized as games about World War I, World War II or Fantasy War. There were almost 6 times as many games made about World War II than World War I and Fantasy War games. Across the three, World War I games have a slightly better average rating but overall they have similar ratings.\n\n\nReferences\nOriginal Source: https://boardgamegeek.com/ Tidy Tuesday Source: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2019/2019-03-12/readme.md"
