In the fall of 2025 I took Data Visualization at Harvey Mudd College with Professor Sophie Engle. We worked in Observable using a combination of Markdown, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and made visualizations with both Observable Plot and D3. My public Observable notebooks can be seen [here!](https://observablehq.com/@personal-projects17?tab=notebooks)
